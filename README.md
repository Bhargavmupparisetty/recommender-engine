# Recommender Engine for Small Shops

Welcome to the **Recommender Engine** project. This tool is designed to help small retail shops optimize their inventory management and increase revenue through intelligent recommendations based on past transactions. The system is implemented using a terminal-based interface, leveraging a simple SQLite database to store transaction records and a recommendation engine to provide actionable insights for shop owners.

## Why This Recommender Engine is Important for Small Shops

In small retail environments, managing inventory efficiently is critical to improving sales and customer satisfaction. Often, shop owners rely on intuition or historical sales data to make decisions about which items to stock. However, this approach may overlook key patterns in customer behavior, such as:

- **Frequently bought items**: Identifying the items that are consistently in demand.
- **Items bought together**: Understanding which products are commonly purchased as a pair or group.
- **Seasonal or periodic demand**: Gaining insights into the products that sell well during specific time frames (weekends, holidays, etc.).

By automating the analysis of sales data, this recommender engine helps shop owners make informed decisions about their inventory. It allows them to stock the right items at the right time, reduce waste, and maximize revenue. The recommendation reports generated by the engine can help shop owners streamline their purchasing and increase sales by anticipating customer needs.

## Features
- **Terminal Interface**: Simple, intuitive text-based interface where users can add, update, and delete transaction records.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Analyzes transaction data to generate reports that identify frequently bought items and commonly bought item pairs within a given timeframe.
- **Report Generation**: Shop owners can print or save the generated reports to assist with future purchasing decisions.

## Technical Overview

### Database
This project uses **SQLite**, a lightweight and efficient database that is ideal for small-scale applications like this. The database stores transaction data, including:
- **Original transaction details** (such as product names)
- **Amount spent**
- **Customer information**
- **Billing date**

### Terminal-Based UI
The terminal interface is built using **Tkinter**, which provides a simple way to interact with the system through text-based commands. Users can:
- Add new billing entries
- Update existing entries
- Delete transaction records
- Generate and view recommendation reports based on historical data

### Recommender Engine
The core of the system is the **Recommender Engine**, which applies data science techniques to transaction data to derive actionable insights. By analyzing patterns over a specified timeframe, the system can:
- Identify frequently bought items
- Highlight items that are commonly purchased together
- Generate a report for shop owners, which can be saved or printed for future reference

## Usage Instructions
1. **Add a transaction**: 
    ```bash
    recommender> add_billing <item_name> <amount> <customer_name>
    ```
2. **Update a transaction**: 
    ```bash
    recommender> update_billing <id> <new_amount>
    ```
3. **Delete a transaction**: 
    ```bash
    recommender> delete_billing <id>
    ```
4. **Generate a recommendation report**: 
    ```bash
    recommender> recommend <start_date> <end_date>
    ```
5. **Exit the system**: 
    ```bash
    recommender> exit
    ```
